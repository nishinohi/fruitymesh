= Implementing a Custom Module

WARNING: Judging from past experiences, the code snippets in this tutorial tend to outdate quite quickly. We always try to keep it up to date, however if something slips through that is not working anymore as described, please have a look at the reference implementation in `fruitymesh/src/examples/PingModule.cpp/.h`. We would also be very thankful if you open an issue on Github about your findings.

This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a new FruityMesh module. You'll implement a PingModule that allows you to ping a node and get its response. You'd normally implement ping functionality into the Node, StatusReporter or DebugModule, which is where it belongs, but the use-case acts as a good and easy example for building your own module. You can find the finished files in the folder `src/examples` or you can just follow the tutorial.

== What Is A Module?

Modules are used to structure functionality that doesn't directly interfere with the mesh-logic. Modules extend the `Module` class. Each module has the possibility to save a *persistent configuration* in flash. It can be loaded or unloaded and it is possible to decide which modules are part of the firmware during compile time through a *featureset*. A module can choose to register a *UART listener* and react on commands or *output to UART* for logging or communication purposes. It can also *send data packets* through the mesh and *receive data*.

There are two types of modules, the core modules that belong to FruityMesh and VendorModules, that allow every developer to extend the functionality with custom code.

Here is an overview over some of the handlers that a Module can use:

* *ConfigurationLoadedHandler*: Is called when a new Module configuration is loaded.
* *TimerEventHandler*: Is called at a fixed interval to do periodic tasks.
* Differene *Ble Event Handlers*: Several handlers that are called when low level ble events occur.
* *MeshMessageReceivedEventHandler*: Delivers data that has been sent over the mesh.
* *TerminalCommandHandler*: Gets called when data is received over UART.

For a full list, check the `Module.h` file.

== Creating A Ping Module

The following guide outlines the steps to implement a simple module that can ping another node over the network and parse the response.

=== Step 0

Move the already existing PingModule implementation out of the FruityMesh repository. It is located in `fruitymesh/src/examples/PingModule.cpp/.h`. This guide will show you how you can reimplement this module. You might not want to remove it, so you can always compare your solution to the already existing one.

=== Step 1

First, copy and rename the `VendorTemplateModule.cpp` and `VendorTemplateModule.h` file from  the `src/examples` directory into `src/modules/PingModule.cpp` and  `src/modules/PingModule.h`. You need to refactor the method names and some other variables. Use the search function and look for the string `template` everywhere in these two files and rename everything (e.g. "VendorTemplateModule", "VENDOR_TEMPLATE_MODULE", ....) accordingly to "PingModule" or "PING_MODULE" while keeping the lower and upper case writing.

=== Step 2

Activate your module by instantiating it in the featureset `config/featuresets/github_dev_nrf52.cpp` where all the other modules are instantiated. You might need to increase the MAX_MODULE_COUNT in `src/base/GlobalState.h` if the compiler complains. Your PingModule constructor needs a VendorModuleId for instantiation. All core moduleIds are specified in FmTypes.h (enum ModuleId) but you need to use a VendorModuleId. You should have created a constant with the name `PING_MODULE_ID` while renaming everything. You can use `GET_VENDOR_MODULE_ID(0xABCD, 2)` to assign a VendorModuleId. You can also replace 0xABCD with your https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers/[company identifier] if you already have one.

The initialization inside the featureset may look like this:

[source,C++]
----
size += GS->InitializeModule<PingModule>(createModule);
----

You have to add the return value of `InitializeModule` to the size of all modules and pass the boolean parameter `createModule` so that the firmware is able to  determine how much memory must be allocated for all the modules.

You should also add an include to the newly `"PingModule.h"` file.

Once the module's .cpp file is in the vendor folder, it will automatically be included in the compilation by the `CMakeLists.txt` in the parent directory.

=== Step 3

Now go ahead and try to compile the binary and flash it to a device. Connect a serial terminal as mentioned in xref:Quick-Start.adoc[Quick Start] and input *get_modules this*. You should now see a list of modules and the ID of your new Ping module should be part of it.

It doesn't do much yet. You will now add more functionality.

=== Step 4

Your PingModule does already overwrite a few of the methods in its base-class. One of these is the TerminalCommandHandler. It is kept simple for this tutorial and only implements the ping command so that it can be triggered via a locally connected terminal. (It would also be possible to trigger a remote node to send a ping and communicate the result back to another node).

In the TerminalCommandHandler, add the following lines to the beginning of the function:

[source,C++]
----
if(TERMARGS(0, "pingmod")){
    //Get the id of the target node
    NodeId targetNodeId = Utility::StringToU16(commandArgs[1]);
    logt("PINGMOD", "Trying to ping node %u", targetNodeId);

    //TODO: Send ping packet to that node

    return TerminalCommandHandler::SUCCESS;
}
----

The command name and command arguments should be in lowercase letters to be consistent with other commands.

Next, flash it to your device again and watch if it reacts on your pingmod command. If it does not, make sure you are using the logtag "PINGMOD" and you either enable it by writing *debug pingmod* in the terminal first, or you enable the logtag by default in FruityMesh.cpp.

=== Step 5

Now that the module is reacting to our command, you are ready to send the ping packet. We will use a predefined message format called xref:Specification.adoc#connPacketModuleVendor[connPacketModuleVendor]. This packet is intended to be used for triggering actions and for responding to these triggers. It has a special message header that contains the VendorModuleId and an actionType. This will ensure that they do not interfere with mesh messages or messages from other modules.

To keep our module messages organized, add an enum that contains all of our messages in the `private:` section of our `PingModule.h` file:

[source,C++]
----
enum PingModuleTriggerActionMessages{
    TRIGGER_PING=0
};
----

Next, add the code that is responsible for sending this packet to the other node. The previously written code now looks like this:

[source,C++]
----
if(TERMARGS(0, "pingmod")){
    //Get the id of the target node
    NodeId targetNodeId = Utility::StringToU16(commandArgs[1]);
    logt("PINGMOD", "Trying to ping node %u", targetNodeId);

    //Some data
    u8 data[1];
    data[0] = 123;

    //Send ping packet to that node
    SendModuleActionMessage(
            MessageType::MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION,
            targetNodeId,
            PingModuleTriggerActionMessages::TRIGGER_PING,
            0,
            data,
            1, //size of payload
            false
    );

    return TerminalCommandHandler::SUCCESS;
}
----

This code creates a buffer of 1 byte and fills in some data (123). This data is not necessary for a ping and is only added for illustration purpose. The message is sent as a ModuleMessage with the VendorModuleId automatically added by the `SendModuleActionMessage` method. The actionType is TRIGGER_PING. The message type `MessageType::MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION` is used for sending messages that await a response.

The ConnectionManager will handle the transmission of this packet, it will copy the packet to its buffer and queue the packet transmission. It is important to pass the size of the payload (1). The last parameter is used to specify that this packet should be transmitted by using BLE-unacknowledged packet transmission (WRITE_CMD) which should always be used.

=== Step 6

Next, you will check if the packet arrived at its destination. Implement the MeshMessageReceivedEventHandler in the PingModule. It looks like this:

[source,C++]
----
void PingModule::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(BaseConnection* connection, BaseConnectionSendData* sendData, ConnPacketHeader const * packetHeader)
{
    //Must call superclass for handling
    Module::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(connection, sendData, packetHeader);

    //Filter trigger_action messages
    if(packetHeader->messageType == MessageType::MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION && sendData->dataLength >= SIZEOF_CONN_PACKET_MODULE_VENDOR){
        ConnPacketModuleVendor const * packet = (ConnPacketModuleVendor const *)packetHeader;

        //Check if our module is meant and we should trigger an action
        if(packet->moduleId == vendorModuleId){
            //It's a ping message
            if(packet->actionType == PingModuleTriggerActionMessages::TRIGGER_PING){

                //Inform the user
                logt("PINGMOD", "Ping request received with data: %d", packet->data[0]);

                //TODO: Send ping response
            }
        }
    }
}
----

In `PingModule.h`, you must now also add the definition for this handler or uncomment it.

You can now perform a simple test by flashing this new firmware on your development board again. There is a simple trick that allows you to test the functionality with a single node by pinging the node itself:

image:tutorial-pingmod2.png[pingmod_2]

The ConnectionManager will parse the packet and will route it back to the `MeshMessageReceivedHandler` without broadcasting it because the nodeId is the same as its own. As you can see, the packet triggered the appropriate action in the node.

=== Step 7

With this working, you should now perform a test with two different nodes. Flash both of them, connect with two terminals and watch how the packet is delivered:

image:tutorial-pingmod3.png[pingmod_3]

=== Step 8

Now, a proper ping message should, well, ... pong. That's why there is a need for a return packet. Go to `PingModule.h` and add another enum that contains action responses:

[source,C++]
----
enum PingModuleActionResponseMessages{
    PING_RESPONSE=0
};
----

Then, go back to your .cpp file and insert this updated code:

[source,C++]
----
void PingModule::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(BaseConnection* connection, BaseConnectionSendData* sendData, ConnPacketHeader const * packetHeader)
{
    //Must call superclass for handling
    Module::MeshMessageReceivedHandler(connection, sendData, packetHeader);

    //Filter trigger_action messages
    if(packetHeader->messageType == MessageType::MODULE_TRIGGER_ACTION){
        ConnPacketModuleVendor const * packet = (ConnPacketModuleVendor const *)packetHeader;

        //Check if our module is meant and we should trigger an action
        if(packet->moduleId == vendorModuleId && sendData->dataLength >= SIZEOF_CONN_PACKET_MODULE_VENDOR){
            //It's a ping message
            if(packet->actionType == PingModuleTriggerActionMessages::TRIGGER_PING){

                //Inform the user
                logt("PINGMOD", "Ping request received with data: %d", packet->data[0]);

                u8 data[2];
                data[0] = packet->data[0];
                data[1] = 111;

                //Send ping packet to that node
                SendModuleActionMessage(
                        MessageType::MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE,
                        packetHeader->sender,
                        PingModuleActionResponseMessages::PING_RESPONSE,
                        0,
                        data,
                        2,
                        false
                );
            }
        }
    }

    //Parse Module action_response messages
    if(packetHeader->messageType == MessageType::MODULE_ACTION_RESPONSE && sendData->dataLength >= SIZEOF_CONN_PACKET_MODULE_VENDOR){

        ConnPacketModuleVendor const * packet = (ConnPacketModuleVendor const *)packetHeader;

        //Check if our module is meant and we should trigger an action
        if(packet->moduleId == vendorModuleId)
        {
            //Somebody reported its connections back
            if(packet->actionType == PingModuleActionResponseMessages::PING_RESPONSE){
                logt("PINGMOD", "Ping came back from %u with data %d, %d", packet->header.sender, packet->data[0], packet->data[1]);
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This code sends a response to the ping request, includes the data that came with the initial request and adds some more data. Also, it adds another condition that checks for the reply to the ping request and prints it out on the terminal.

=== Final Step

That's it. You should now be able to ping any node in the mesh network and see its response. The intermediate nodes will automatically route all traffic without having to know what kind of message it is. This means that you can have different modules on each node in the network and they will still be interoperable.

image:tutorial-pingmod4.png[pingmod_4]

You would probably want to use a counter with the ping message to generate a handle for a ping. Then, you'd be able to calculate the time that it took for the packet to come back through the mesh. And as indicated in the beginning, you would not necessarily want to create a new module for pinging other nodes but you'd have that functionality in a core module. Make sure to take a look at the appTimer and time syncing capabilities of FruityMesh if you want to extend your module with more functionality.

This concludes the tutorial. Have fun implementing new modules for FruityMesh!
