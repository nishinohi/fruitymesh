= FruityMesh Algorithm

== Introduction
A mesh should be able to build and
manage all connections without user interaction. There is one big
restriction when it comes to BLE connections. Having more than one
connection as a peripheral can degrade mesh performance and lead to
connection losses. Using one connection as a peripheral and up to three
connections as a central has proven a good configuration for mesh
connections. With these settings, the following will lead to problems
where two nodes are not able to connect to each other because their one
connection as a peripheral is already taken.

There is no way to know the size - or the participating nodes - of a
mesh in advance. Distributing the presence of a node over long distances
would be a bad idea because of the time it takes and the energy it
costs. This means that every node can only see its surroundig nodes.

== Simulator
There is a xref:CherrySim.adoc[Simulator] available that
illustrates how the algorithm works. It allows to apply
different configurations and see how the mesh reacts.

== Node
Each node saves a few variables like network ID, cluster ID,
cluster size and its own ID. Additionally, it keeps some information for
each of its connections.

During discovery, it broadcasts its _nodeId_, _clusterSize_ and _clusterId_
along with a few other measures in special advertising packets (xref:Specification.adoc[JOIN_ME]>> packets).
It also scans for some time to receive
discovery packets of surrounding nodes. From these packets, it selects
the best connection partner and establishes a connection to it.

== Clustering
The real trick here is the clustering. Because every
node knows the size of the cluster that it's part of, it uses this information
as a criteria when connecting to others. Big clusters can always decide to
which nodes they want to connect and smaller clusters will have to obey.
Any change in cluster size due to connection or disconnection is
broadcast through the exisiting connections.

After a few xref:Specification.adoc#_JOIN_ME_Packet_(MessageType_1)[JOIN_ME] packets
have been collected, they are processed in the ClusterScore function to
determine the best connection partner. A node never tries to connect
to a node with the same _clusterId_ to prevent loops.

== Handshake
After receiving the xref:Specification.adoc#_JOIN_ME_Packet_(MessageType_1)[JOIN ME] packets, some time has passed
and the other node might already be in another cluster or in a different
state than before. This is why the two nodes will first do a handshake
after connecting to pass the latest information to each other. Only
one Handshake must happen at a time to prevent race conditions. Once
they are satisfied with their partner, the connection is used,
otherwise it is disconnected.

== States
The algorithm uses a state machine that switches between
different DISCOVERY and HANDSHAKE states. This helps the node to reduce
its energy usage.

== Self-Healing
Once a connection in the cluster breaks up, the smaller
cluster distributes a new cluster ID among its nodes. This
repairs the missing connection using a similar path.

After each connection loss, a node will increment its
connection-loss-counter. This counter is used together with the _nodeId_
to generate a _clusterId_. This is necessary because there might be cases
where the original node of a cluster can't join the cluster anymore if
it generates the same _clusterId_ again.

== Connection
Master Bit:  Because a node can't always know for certain if it is
part of the bigger cluster, there may be times when two
connected nodes both think they are part of the bigger cluster. This
would pose a threat to the mesh once the connection drops. Therefore,
each connection is assigned a _masterBit_ that is passed to the node that
is part of the bigger cluster. With this, it is only possible that the
_masterBit_ is in transition during a disconnect and both cluster must
dissolve, but they can no longer form any islands.

algorithm is welcome to take a look at
