= Native Renderer

== General
Besides the web renderer, CherrySim also supports a native renderer. The native renderer has several advantages and disadvantages compared to the web renderer, enumerated below.

.Comparison
|===
|Advantages |Disadvantages 

|Much more responsive rendering. The current state of the simulator is represented accurate.|More complex to set up.
|The renderer can give data back to the simulator.|Can slow down execution as it is run in the same thread as the simulator.
|Connections are visible in red before they get turned into logical BaseConnections.|The direction of the connections is not visible (yet).
|It is possible to pause simulations steps so that a closer look at the mesh build up can be done.|If a breakpoint is triggered, the renderer is no longer responding.
|It shows the sent packets, giving an intuitive way to see how much traffic is happening between the nodes.|The Rendering is no longer available once the simulation stops.
|More stats about nodes are visible.|
|Simulator stats like width, height, and the number of nodes are visible.|
|Simpler Camera Control. Drag & Drop the mouse to move, scroll wheel to zoom.

== Setup

1. Download & install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
2. When generating the CMake files, pass -DFM_NATIVE_RENDERER_ENABLED=ON to it. For example: cmake .. -A Win32 -DFM_NATIVE_RENDERER_ENABLED=ON
