= Fruitymesh

FruityMesh is the reference implementation of the **BlueRange** initiative. It was the first open source implementation of a mesh network that is based on standard *Bluetooth Low Energy 4.1 connections*. In contrast to meshes that use advertising and scanning, this allows for a network run with *battery powered* devices. FruityMesh works with the Nordic nRF52 chipset in combination with the *S132/S140 SoftDevices* and enables tons of devices to connect to each other with its auto-meshing capabilities. It is *always connected* with configurable connection intervals of *7.5 ms to 4 seconds* while still being able to run on batteries.

== BlueRange
BlueRange is our commercial product that includes our Mesh, MeshGateway, Platform, Asset Tracking and much more. Have a look at our website:

https://www.bluerange.io/

== News
We have invested some time in extending our opensource documentation, so be sure to take a look at all the new additions in the documentation and especially check out the xref:Features.adoc[Features] page.

Make sure to take a look at the xref:Concepts.adoc[Concepts] document if you already know a bit about the Bluetooth SIG mesh to see how the two implementations compare.

== Where To Begin
Before you begin, you should have at least two boards with the nRF52 chipset and either an external or an onboard debugger. If not, we recommend that you get two https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits[DevKits from Nordic] to get you started as easily and quickly as possible. Next, have a look at the xref:Quick-Start.adoc[Quick Start] page to get everything running. Then test some commands from the xref:BasicUsage.adoc[Basic Usage] page. Afterwards, you could follow one of the xref:Tutorials.adoc[Tutorials].

== What To Expect
Take some nRF devices, flash them with FruityMesh and expect them to connect to each other in an instant. Open the terminal and send them some commands over the mesh, trigger LEDs or watch some data going through. Power consumption is minimal with the correct settings. For a list of some of the features, have a look at the xref:Features.adoc[Features] page.

FruityMesh is **great for attaching sensors / actuators or 3rd party devices** e.g. via UART. Whether you need a mesh of lamps, sensors, want to do asset tracking, etc., FruityMesh will be a great framework to get everything running quickly.

== Talk To Us
We’re interested in contributions of every kind, otherwise we wouldn’t be here on GitHub. If you have any questions on how to help and bring the technology forward, do not hesitate to contact us. Make sure to read the xref:Developers.adoc[Developers] page to find out how to help.

Do not hesitate to ask questions, submit issues and add comments. Mail us through our website for business inquiries or open an issue and label it as _question_ for developer questions.

== Who Are We?

This project is under active development at xref:http://www.mwaysolutions.com/[M-Way Solutions GmbH], Germany.

We use FruityMesh ourselves in conjunction with our custom MeshGateway to build services such as connected lights, asset tracking and much more for our customers.
